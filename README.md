# WeatherAPP-WPF
Weather Information Application - Built with WPF .NET 6 using MVVM architecture.

Model-View-ViewModel architecture is implemented with the below techniques.

* Uses Data Binding
* Uses INofity Property Changed Interface implementations for View-ViewModel-Model communications.
* Uses ICommand Interface implementations - Instead click events for buttons...etc
* Uses ObservableCollection<T> - Sends notifications to View when the list of data changes.
* Uses IValueConverter - To show presentable data in the view, and to convert view inputs to data that is accepted by the model.
